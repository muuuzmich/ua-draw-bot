# Bot architecture:

## Basic idea

Every user action is handeled by corresponding service. Each service has list of BotListeners to handle specific action:

```
{
    type: BotCommandType.ON,
    name: "photo",
    callback: (ctx: Context) => this.imageRecieved(ctx),
}
```

## Services

Any new services should implement singleton pattern. It must extend `BaseService` and implement `initListeners` method. Also to make them work, make sure to pass them into App constructor in `index.ts`.
